# FinDataMan
This file provides information about the FinDataMan website's codebase.

## Project Description
FinDataMan is a personal portfolio website for Arturo Villagomez, a high-performance professional offering practical solutions to the business sector to improve their companies' performance.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Fonts (from Google Fonts)

The website uses a basic one-page layout with sections identified by IDs. Navigation is achieved through a menu with anchor links.

## Key Features

- Hero Section: Introduces FinDataMan and highlights the benefits he provides to clients (empowered, confident, prepared, in control).
- About Me Section: Provide a detailed description of Arturo's experience, profile, and the value he offers businesses.
- Highlights Section: Showcases three key aspects of FinDataMan's services with titles and descriptions.
- Experience Section: Displays previous work experiences with company logos, positions, and links to company websites (if available).
- Skills Section: Uses tabs to showcase different skill sets (financial modeling, corporate finance, product management) with details on each. Potentially uses icons for each skill.
- Contact Section: Provides contact information through social media links (LinkedIn, email, WhatsApp).

## Dependencies
- The website likely relies on external resources like images, icons, and fonts. These should be stored in a dedicated folder (resources in this example).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository containing the website's code.
2. Install any necessary dependencies.
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the website.
